# Introduction
The Consumer Price Index (CPI) dataset represents changes in prices as experienced by Canadian consumers over time. It reflects the cost of a fixed basket of goods and services, capturing only pure price changes by maintaining consistent quantity and quality within the basket. The CPI serves as a crucial indicator of inflation, enabling Canadians to evaluate their purchasing power and financial stability by comparing price trends to income changes.
